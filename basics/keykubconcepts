Pod                                                The smallest unit in Kubernetes .It holds one or more containers that                                                   share network and storage
                                                   when you want to run an app (like one nginx container)

Services                                           Gives your pods a fixed IP and name .so app can talk to each other   
                                                   even if pods restart or move 
                                                   when you want to expose your pods internally or externally

Deployment                                        Tells the kubernetes  how many pods to runn    and handles rolling 
                                                  updates
                                                  when you want to manage replicas of a Pod and auto healing

Replicaset                                        Ensures fixed number of pods running  
                                                   Rarely used directly its used inside the deployment

Namespace                                         Like folders in your cluster -helps organixe and isolate resources
                                                  when you want separation (eg dev/test/prod)

ConfigMap                                         Stores non-sensitive configuration (like key -value pairs)
                                                   when you want to inject  configs  into pods without changing  the 
                                                   image

Secret                                            Stores sensitive info(password,API Keys, certification)
                                                   when you need to secure credentials in pods

Ingress                                           Routes HTTP/HTTPS traffic from outside the cluster to services
                                                  when you want to expose multiple  apps through one domain

Volume                                           A piece of storage  attached to a Pod
                                                 When you need persistent data (logs,database data ,files)

StatefulSet                                      Like deployment,but for stateful app (database,kafka,redis,etc)
                                                 when you need stabel networkids  AND persistend storage

DaemonSet                                        Ensure one pod per Node -used for backgroud system level tasks
                                                   when you need to run a pod on all the node like a monitoring agents

job/cornjob                                     Runs tasks that end (job)  ro repeat on schdule(cornjob) 
                                                 when you need batch or scheduled works

üß© Concept	üí¨ Simple Meaning	üîç When You Use It	‚öôÔ∏è Example
Pod	The smallest unit in Kubernetes. It holds one or more containers that share network & storage.	When you want to run an app (like one Nginx container).	Run an Nginx web server inside a pod.
Service	Gives your Pods a fixed IP & name, so apps can talk to each other even if Pods restart or move.	When you want to expose your Pods internally or externally.	Expose Nginx Pods via a NodePort or LoadBalancer.
Deployment	Tells Kubernetes how many Pods to run, and handles rolling updates.	When you want to manage replicas of a Pod and auto-healing.	Deploy 3 replicas of Nginx that auto-restart if one fails.
ReplicaSet	Ensures a fixed number of Pods are running.	Rarely used directly ‚Äî it‚Äôs used inside Deployments.	Deployment uses ReplicaSet to keep 3 Pods alive.
Namespace	Like folders in your cluster ‚Äî helps organize and isolate resources.	When you want separation (e.g., dev/test/prod environments).	Keep ‚Äúdev‚Äù and ‚Äúprod‚Äù services in different namespaces.
ConfigMap	Stores non-sensitive configuration (key-value pairs).	When you want to inject configs into Pods without changing the image.	Store APP_MODE=production or PORT=8080.
Secret	Stores sensitive info (passwords, API keys, certificates).	When you need to secure credentials in Pods.	Store DB password securely instead of hardcoding it.
Ingress	Routes HTTP/HTTPS traffic from outside the cluster to Services.	When you want to expose multiple apps through one domain.	Example: example.com/api ‚Üí API service, /app ‚Üí UI service.
Volume	A piece of storage attached to a Pod.	When you need persistent data (logs, DB data, files).	Mount a directory that stores user-uploaded images.
StatefulSet	Like Deployment, but for stateful apps (databases, Kafka, Redis, etc.).	When you need stable network IDs and persistent storage.	Deploy MySQL where each Pod keeps its data.
DaemonSet	Ensures one Pod per Node ‚Äî used for background system-level tasks.	When you need to run a Pod on all nodes (like monitoring agents).	Run a log collector or node exporter on every node.
Job / CronJob	Runs tasks that end (Job) or repeat on schedule (CronJob).	When you need batch or scheduled work.	Run a backup every night or clean temp files daily.
