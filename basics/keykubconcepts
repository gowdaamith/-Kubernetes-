Pod                                                The smallest unit in Kubernetes .It holds one or more containers that                                                   share network and storage
                                                   when you want to run an app (like one nginx container)

Services                                           Gives your pods a fixed IP and name .so app can talk to each other   
                                                   even if pods restart or move 
                                                   when you want to expose your pods internally or externally

Deployment                                        Tells the kubernetes  how many pods to runn    and handles rolling 
                                                  updates
                                                  when you want to manage replicas of a Pod and auto healing

Replicaset                                        Ensures fixed number of pods running  
                                                   Rarely used directly its used inside the deployment

Namespace                                         Like folders in your cluster -helps organixe and isolate resources
                                                  when you want separation (eg dev/test/prod)

ConfigMap                                         Stores non-sensitive configuration (like key -value pairs)
                                                   when you want to inject  configs  into pods without changing  the 
                                                   image

Secret                                            Stores sensitive info(password,API Keys, certification)
                                                   when you need to secure credentials in pods

Ingress                                           Routes HTTP/HTTPS traffic from outside the cluster to services
                                                  when you want to expose multiple  apps through one domain

Volume                                           A piece of storage  attached to a Pod
                                                 When you need persistent data (logs,database data ,files)

StatefulSet                                      Like deployment,but for stateful app (database,kafka,redis,etc)
                                                 when you need stabel networkids  AND persistend storage

DaemonSet                                        Ensure one pod per Node -used for backgroud system level tasks
                                                   when you need to run a pod on all the node like a monitoring agents

job/cornjob                                     Runs tasks that end (job)  ro repeat on schdule(cornjob) 
                                                 when you need batch or scheduled works
